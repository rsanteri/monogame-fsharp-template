# monogame-fsharp-template

Very basic template what i used for trying out monogame engine with F# language. I didn't want to have Visual Studio solution when just quickly trying something with monogame. NOTE: This most probably should not be used on production level projects.

## Usage

Only tested with Windows. Requires monogame to be installed.

Run game
`dotnet run`
